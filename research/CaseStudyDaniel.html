                    The Cleveland Clinic writes "Doing a digital detox is a great way to find out if technology is holding you back from living your best life.

             Apple's Screen Time
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                The addition of a "screen time‚Äù section for all Apple devices reflects a growing concern about the use of technology by children and adolescents. As much as I hate to admit it, having parental control over technology, especially what apps and sites kids can access, is a really good idea. The tool allows parents to limit the time children spend on devices, block inappropriate content, see how much time kids are spending on their devices, and see what they are spending it on.

        <p class="text-center"> 
          Research on social media and its effects are ongoing, and I believe that more in depth research on its long term effects will be presented in the near future. The whole twitter saga is also providing people with a moment of reflection; do they really need social media and what will life without twitter look like. The Facebook whistleblower also illustrated the critical issues with the way social media companies are willing to throw users under the bus. Moreover, Apple decision to provide users with more transparency has harbored social media companies' ability to advetise.
