    <h2><Most effective thing seems to be >>> The most effective way to address the root causes of the issue is to raise awareness and understanding about the nature and consequences of social media. </h2>
    <p>Evidence:Johann Hari said that “the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, but connection.” The root of the popularity social media entertains comes from its purpose; to connect people. Thus, the ideas I've presented seem contradicting, however, the connection that social media companies boast has mutated into something else. Connection doesn’t come from watching people post their stories on Instagram, or from 30 second videos on Tik Tok. <br>
    Explanation: Due to social media’s role in connecting people, people don’t see the need to stop using it. The original purpose of social media was to connect people, but connecting over social media cannot be the only way to access the dopamine provided by friendships. There are websites, books, talks, and more that explain in simple terms the ways that social media uses connection to cause anxiety, depression, negative body image, and more. <br>
    Evidence: Another way to combat social media use is to take a step back from social media through a “digital detox.” Said detox is defined by a break - a week to a month - from dopamine or social media or something in between. <br>
    Explanation: Detoxes are great ways to reset your brain, neurochemicals, and your behavior to baseline, healthy levels.” Participating in one can be a great way for people to take a pause and reevaluate their relationships with social media. How much do they really need it? How did the break feel? Did they find other ways to satisfy their boredom? </p><br>
    <h2>Technology is being used by >>> There are an increasing number of apps and tools that can help people to separate social media from their use of the internet. </h2>
    <p>Evidence: SelfControl is an open source application for mac that allows users to block their own access to websites. Freedom is an IOS app that also allows users to limit their screen time. FocusMate is an app that partners users with a human accountability partner. <br>
    Explanation: There are apps that can help users to limit the access they have to social media accounts. Given the addictive nature of these sites, having an extra tool at your disposal to keep you on track is something that everyone should try. Additionally, as the issue of addiction and other negative effects related to social media have been around for relatively long, these sites can serve as effective options for someone seeking help. <br>
    Evidence: Apple recently added a “screen time” section on IOS. <br>
    Explanation: The addition of a "screen time” section for all Apple devices reflects a growing concern about the use of technology by children and adolescents. As much as I hate to admit it, having parental control over technology, especially what apps and sites kids can access, is a really good idea. The tool allows parents to limit the time children spend on devices, block inappropriate content, see how much time kids are spending on their devices, and see what they are spending it on. <br>
    Implication #1 is >>> Be open minded to each person’s unique situation. <br>
    Explanation: Technology, and especially social media, can be used for good. It’s important to understand that some people understand the negative effects of social media, and still choose to use it. Likewise, social media can connect people to one another, so simply saying that “social media is bad” doesn’t acknowledge the positive effects of it. <br>
    Implication #2 is >>> More research needs to be done. <br>
    Explanation: Social media addiction is a topic that hasn’t been studied much, likely due to the fact that social media isn’t that old. Everything should be taken with a grain of salt, and as time goes on, I’m sure more information will be presented. <br>
    Implication #3 is >>> Social media is popular. <br>
    Explanation: This may seem obvious, but it’s an important statement nonetheless. Billions of people use social media in countless ways, and so attempting to change the minds of that many people is impossible. Social media companies hold unfathomable amounts of power and wealth, and despite anyone’s best efforts, questioning their integrity may not do much. </p>
