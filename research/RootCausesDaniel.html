    <h1>Root Causes</h1> <br>
    <p class = "root1">Root cause #1: The “endless scroll” method employed by various social media causes a person to lose one’s sense of time due to the immersiveness and dopamine provided by scrolling through and consuming content. 
        <br>Evidence: “ It is well known that flow goes along with a feeling of time distortion and this is exactly what many developers of social media apps and Freemium games aim to achieve—a person being so immersed that he or she is forgetting about time and space while using a platform or app.” 
        <br>Explanation: As users of social media continue to scroll through content, they are becoming more invested in the content. This puts them in a “flow” state where time is able to pass more quickly without their knowledge. The author phrases it well, social media apps seek to do this to forcefully immerse the user in their app. 
        <br>Evidence “The behavior of endless scrolling is enhanced, because the user finds from time to time something rewarding (e.g., a funny or interesting video), hence intermittent conditioning principles are observed here (see also research on intermittent conditioning principles in the context of slot machine mechanisms by Harrigan & Dixon [52]).”
        <br>Explanation: In this piece of evidence, the author seeks to explain the way that dopamine plays into the addictiveness of social media. Basically, a user is trained to continue scrolling due to the “intermittent” dopamine rewards. The user will occasionally stumble upon a video that they may really enjoy, but because that is not guaranteed with every scroll, they will continue to scroll. Like lab rats, users are being conditioned to spend more and more time on social media for that dopamine reward. 
        <br>Implications: This root cause of the addictiveness of social media gives light to the sinister methods employed by social media companies. Our brains are being changed in order to make us into the perfect consumers, and there must be something done about it. It’s an issue that doesn’t contain an obvious solution, however I believe that the will power of the human being is strong enough to understand what is being done to them. The more people educate themselves, the more they will realize the terrible things going on within the world of social media. 
        <br> <br> <p class="root2"></p>Root cause #2 Social media companies have harnessed the power of social pressure via “nudges” to force users to spend more time responding and interacting on their platforms.</p> 
        <br>Evidence “If a user sends a message to a friend, the sender is presented with two gray ticks, which means that the message has successfully arrived at the recipient’s phone. If the recipient reads the message, the grey ticks turn blue. As both sides know about these rules, social pressure emerges.”
        <br>Explanation: This quote helps the reader understand the basic principles behind nudging. Once a message is read, the sender is alerted, and thus, the reader feels pressure to respond. It’s such a silly concept in my mind, why let someone know you’ve seen the message. It only serves to pressure someone to respond faster. Regardless, the utilization of FOMO is also present as the users may start to conjure up reasons for why someone has not responded to, yet seen, their message. 
        <br>Evidence “The default mode of WhatsApp comes with the ‘double tick function’ being activated. Most users do not know that they are able to deactivate this app-feature. In general, the ‘power of defaults’ is a well-known principle applicable to decision making in many different areas and especially in software applications [63,64].”
        <br>Explanation: This piece of evidence speaks to the, again, sneaky ways social media apps hook users into using tools that likely are harming them. In my own experience, it is difficult to fight back against the “power” of the defaults, as I have to take the time to look up and figure out the usually complex steps necessary to disable a certain feature. An example that comes to mind is youtube shorts. YouTube decided to become tik tok and has subsequently added identical videos to its platform. There is no way to deactivate them, and the attempts to circumvent the issue have been stopped by google (downloadable extensions). 
        <br>Implications: Social media companies use social pressure and hidden features to create apps that force users to stay on them for longer periods of time. Again, the best way that I see to combat this issue is to find a credible source that can provide information about the presence of hidden features and potentially, ways to turn said features off.
